Can you guess what it is yet?

Bindown is a tool to extract and compile code from markdown files
in which the code is hex, to be encoded to binary.

The idea is that if you want to directly edit a binary file, you
might want to explain yourself in the source, which is a but difficult,
since there is no source.  So bindown is your source.  You can still
write in binary (hex; as opposed to asm or whatever) but you get to 
bloat your file with wheeze.
